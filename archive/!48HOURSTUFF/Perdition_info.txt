Title: Perdition
Team: James Kotzian, Julia Sokolow, Helen Lai

Description:
You are a nature photographer that happened to fall down a pit
leading to the underworld while snapping photos of a cavern. 
Escape all manner of disfigured creatures and search for a 
way back!

Theme Compliance:
The game takes place in the underworld, a place where some 
people consider the ending destination for humans. However, 
someone living is direly out of place, and the denizens will 
want to deal with that! The Grims, the ghostly monsters with 
claws, will try to snuff you, but their boss is the one you 
really have to worry about... He is in the background, moving 
ever forward, serving as a constant reminder that the end is 
nearing.
